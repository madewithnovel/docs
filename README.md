# Introduction

Thank you for purchasing Novel. We hope you find value in this software as much as we do from your purchase.

Novel is a full-stack SaaS starter kit built with Node.js, Next.js, React, PostgreSQL, and best practices that can get your team up and running as fast as possible.

Novel was built to scratch an itch on our experience of building and re-building blocks of features for different companies and sites. This is the amalgamation of those.

The product suite includes:
