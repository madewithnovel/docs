# Validation

novel makes use of 2 validation mechanisms: jsonschema and zod. both serve specific purpose, for shaping requests and responses and for verifying input.

although these are optional, it is recommended that you build your system utilizing these tools as much as possible.

### Api requests and responses

jsonschema, used within fastify, makes it easy to enforce how your api should behave before, during, and after processing. this, along with the fast performance brought by fastify, makes your system a bit more resilient when dealing with APIs

it is also a easier to generate clients via OpenAPI/swagger generated by the novel system. these definitions are used internally by the novel web client to easily expose routes as an RPC and give great development experience.

jsonschema is recommended to be used for api request/response shapes. client side validation should use zod instead.

see novel server for more info

### input validation

any active validations that you need during development can be supported by zod. all database models have an accompanying zod definition that can be reused and extended.

validations within the client should make use of zod as much as possible

* validating from a service
* using with a form
